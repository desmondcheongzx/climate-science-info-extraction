Decadal changes in fish assemblages in waters near the Ieodo ocean research station (East China Sea) in relation to climate change from 1984 to 2010
We compiled and analyzed past time-series data to evaluate changes in oceanographic conditions and marine ecosystems near the Ieodo ocean research station (IORS) in the East China Sea (N 31°15′–33°45′, E 124°15′–127°45′) in relation to longterm changes in climate and global warming. The environment data we used was a depth-specific time-series of temperature and salinity for the water columns at 175 fixed stations along 22 oceanographic lines in Korean waters, based on bimonthly measurements since 1961 taken by the National Fisheries Research & Development Institute. As an indicator for the ecosystem status of the waters off Ieodo, we analyzed species composition in biomass of fishes caught by Korean fishing vessels in the waters near the IORS (1984–2010) and summarized the data in relation to the environmental changes using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). To detect step changes in the time-series of environmental factors, we applied a sequential t-test analysis of regime shift. Correspondence analysis detected a major shift in fish assemblage structure between 1990 and 1993: the dominant species was filefish during 1981–1992, but chub mackerel during 1992–2007. This shift in fish assemblage structure seemed to be related to the well-established 1989 regime shift in the North Pacific, which was confirmed again with respect to temperature in the Yellow Sea and the Korea Strait (but not in the waters off the IORS). In overall from 1984 to 2010, salinity was more important than water temperature in CCA, implying that the fluctuation of the Tsushima warm current is a most important force driving the long-term changes in fish assemblage structure in the waters off the IORS. Further multidisciplinary researches are required to identify oceanographic and biological processes that link climate-driven physical changes to fish recruitment and habitat range fluctuations.

Variation patterns of extreme precipitation and relation to ocean-atmospheric climate in Sichuan province China from 1961 to 2017
Based on daily precipitation records in the Sichuan province, spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation from 1961 to 2017 and the relation to ocean-atmospheric climate were investigated. The trends and their statistical significance were computed with the nonparametric Sen’s and Mann–Kendall tests. The characteristics of mutation and period were investigated with heuristic segmentation and continuous wavelet transform. The relations between extreme precipitation and ocean-atmospheric climate were diagnosed by cross-wavelet analysis. The results comprised three aspects. (1) The intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme precipitation increased in the Sichuan plateau, while the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation decreased, but the duration of extreme precipitation did not change in the Sichuan basin. The contrary trends of extreme precipitation indices may have been influenced by the complex local geography, dramatically increased human activity, and source transportation of water vapor. (2) Temporally, the trends in extreme precipitation indices constituted slight changes in the Sichuan province. The Sichuan province experienced notable climate change because abrupt change points were observed for most of the extreme precipitation indices. Extreme precipitation was a fluctuation process from 1961 to 2017. (3) Because there was a decrease in precipitation during the warm phase periods of El Niño events and an increase during the cool phase periods of La Niña events in the Sichuan province, we show that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has longer and stronger relations with extreme precipitation than the South Asian Summer Monsoon (SASM) or East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). The results of the present study will facilitate better decisions concerning preparedness for extreme precipitation events and management of water hazards in the Sichuan province.

Collapse and rapid resumption of Atlantic meridional circulation linked to deglacial climate changes
The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation is widely believed to affect climate. Changes in ocean circulation have been inferred from records of the deep water chemical composition derived from sedimentary nutrient proxies, but their impact on climate is difficult to assess because such reconstructions provide insufficient constraints on the rate of overturning. Here we report measurements of 231Pa/230Th, a kinematic proxy for the meridional overturning circulation, in a sediment core from the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. We find that the meridional overturning was nearly, or completely, eliminated during the coldest deglacial interval in the North Atlantic region, beginning with the catastrophic iceberg discharge Heinrich event H1, 17,500 yr ago, and declined sharply but briefly into the Younger Dryas cold event, about 12,700 yr ago. Following these cold events, the 231Pa/230Th record indicates that rapid accelerations of the meridional overturning circulation were concurrent with the two strongest regional warming events during deglaciation. These results confirm the significance of variations in the rate of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation for abrupt climate changes.

Changes in Fish Viral Disease Outbreaks in the Coastal Area of Korea Due to Increasing Water Temperature, an Impact of Climate Change
The impact of global warming on aquatic systems has been a priority research area in the past decade. However, the possibility that increased temperatures will cause shifts in viral disease outbreaks has not been well addressed. In the present study, with increasing water temperature (WT) in the coastal area of Korea, we estimated the possibility of changes in fish viral diseases. From the present time, WT may rise between 0.62 and by 2050, and the effect on aquaculture could be more adverse than benefitial. Red seabream iridovirus disease (RSIVD) and viral nervous necrosis (VNN) cause high mortality above 22 and , respectively, and outbreaks could commence earlier and persist for prolonged periods. Nevertheless, the period of occurrence of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), which outbreaks at a lower WT (), could be shorter than the current infectious period. Thermal stress in fish causes reductions in growth and immunocompetence; thus, increases in summer WT can lead to the development of new viral diseases. WT has a strong influence on fish population dynamics; therefore, entry of new viruses and changes in the prevalence of infection can be expected if carrier fishes are introduced or migrate to Korean waters.

Multi-decadal Changes in Fish Communities Jeju Island in Relation to Climate Change
We compiled and analyzed long-term time-series data collected in Korea to evaluate changes in oceanographic conditions and marine ecosystems near Jeju Island (, ) from 1981 to 2010. Environmental data included depth-specific time series of temperature and salinity that have been measured bimonthly since 1961 in water columns at 175 fixed stations along 22 oceanographic lines in Korean waters by the National Fisheries Research & Development Institute, and time series of estimated volume transport of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and Korea Strait Bottom Cold Water (KSBCW) for the period from 1961 to 2008. We analyzed the species composition in terms of biomass of fish species caught by Korean fishing vessels in the waters near Jeju Island (1981-2010). Data were summarized and related to environmental changes using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The CCA detected major shifts in fish community structure between 1982 and 1983 and between 1990 and 1992; the dominant species were a filefish during 1981-1992 and chub mackerel from 1992 to 2007. CCA suggested that water temperature and salinity in the mixed layer and the volume transport of the TWC and the KSBCW were significantly related to the long-term changes in the fish community in the waters off Jeju Island. Fish community shifts seemed to be related to the well-established 1989 regime shift in the North Pacific. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms driving climate change effects on the thermal windows and habitat ranges of commercial species to develop fisheries management plans based on reliable projections of long-term changes in the oceanographic conditions in waters off Jeju Island.

Latitudinal shifts in the distribution of exploited fishes in Korean waters during the last 30 years: a consequence of climate change
Sea surface temperatures in Korean waters have increased by approximately 1 °C during the past 40 years, implying possible range shifts of marine fishes and invertebrates. We analyzed spatially explicit, commercial catch data for 12 major fish species collected from 1984 to 2010 in Korean waters to evaluate and project their range shifts based on climate-driven hydrographic changes simulated by a general circulation model under a climate change scenario. There were significant relationships between the mean latitude of the catch distribution and water temperature for seven of the 12 species examined. Our circulation model projected that temperature stratification in the Korea Strait will disappear by 2030, and our empirical relationships predicted that the ranges of five of the fish species examined will shift poleward by 19–71 km from the 2000s to the 2030s. Compared with studies of demersal fishes in the western North Atlantic and the North Sea, our estimated speeds of shift in mean latitude of fishes were, on average, slower by factors of 2.3 and 5.7, respectively. This suggests that the pattern of range shift of marine species can vary regionally, depending on oceanographic and geomorphologic conditions. International cooperative research among fisheries scientists from countries throughout the region, especially Japan and China, is required to more reliably and comprehensively assess and project the range shifts of fish species. This will provide a scientific basis for the development of fishery policies and their adaptation to climate change in the western North Pacific.

Asynchronous responses of fish assemblages to climate-driven ocean regime shifts between the upper and deep layer in the Ulleung basin of the East Sea from 1986 to 2010
Past studies suggested that a basin-wide regime shift occurred in 1988–1989, impacting marine ecosystem and fish assemblages in the western North Pacific. However, the detailed mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are still yet unclear. In the Ulleung basin of the East Sea, filefish, anchovy and sardine dominated the commercial fish catches in 1986–1992, but thereafter common squid comprised > 60% of the total catch in 1993–2010. To illuminate the mechanisms causing this dramatic shift in dominant fisheries species, I related changes in depth-specific oceanographic conditions from 0 to 500 m to inter-annual changes in the fish assemblage structure from 1986 to 2010. In the upper layer of 50–100 m depths, water temperature suddenly increased in 1987–1989, and consequently warm-water epi-pelagic species (anchovy, chub mackerel, and common squid) became dominant, while sardine, relatively cold-water epi-pelagic species, nearly disappeared. An annual index of the volume transport by the Korea Strait Bottom Cold Water, originating from the deep water of the Ulleung Basin, displayed a sudden intensification in 1992–1993, accompanied by decreased water temperature and increased water density in the deep water and replacement of dominant bentho-pelagic species from filefish, warm-water species, to herring and cod, cold-water species. The results suggest that climate-driven oceanic changes and the subsequent ecological impacts can occur asynchronously, often with time lags of several years, between the upper and the deep layer, and between epi-pelagic and deepwater fish assemblages.

Fishing vs. Climate Change: An Example of Filefish (Thamnaconus modestus) in the Northern East China Sea
The main cause of annual fluctuations in catch and species composition of fisheries is usually uncertain, but a prevailing view has been that fishing effects are more critical than environmental variability. Filefish is a good anecdote: many Korean fisheries scientists have attributed the sudden collapse of Korean filefish fisheries in the early 1990s to overfishing, especially by trawl fisheries in the northern East China Sea (NECS). However, interdisciplinary researches have revealed that climate-driven, multi-decadal variability in oceanic conditions impacts both fish and fisheries around the world. To test the two alternative hypotheses (i.e., fishing and climate) as the major cause of the sudden decline of filefish, we compared fisheries data of filefish from the adjacent countries of the NECS and analyzed oceanographic conditions in relation to changes in species composition of fish assemblages in the NECS. Results suggested that the basin-wide, 1989 regime shift in the North Pacific and the subsequent shrinkage of habitat range to the southwest were the major cause of the sudden decline of filefish catch in the NECS. Locally, shifts in water temperature and currents were identified in the NECS for the early 1990s, but further physiology-oriented researches are required to understand the detailed mechanism of climate-change effects on filefish stocks in the marginal seas of East Asia.

Climate-change driven range shifts of anchovy biomass projected by bio-physical coupling individual based model in the marginal seas of East Asia
Recent studies in the western North Pacific reported a declining standing stock biomass of anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) in the Yellow Sea and a climate-driven southward shift of anchovy catch in Korean waters. We investigated the effects of a warming ocean on the latitudinal shift of anchovy catch by developing and applying individual-based models (IBMs) based on a regional ocean circulation model and an IPCC climate change scenario. Despite the greater uncertainty, our two IBMs projected that, by the 2030s, the strengthened Tsushima warm current in the Korea Strait and the East Sea, driven by global warming, and the subsequent confinement of the relatively cold water masses within the Yellow Sea will decrease larval anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea, but will increase it in the Korea Strait and the East Sea. The decreasing trend of anchovy biomass in the Yellow Sea was reproduced by our models, but further validation and enhancement of the models is required together with extended ichthyoplankton surveys to understand and reliably project range shifts of anchovy and the impacts such range shifts will have on the marine ecosystems and fisheries in the region.

Dynamics of the Reproduction Period of the Sea Raven Hemitripterus villosus (Hemitripteridae) in the Southwestern Part of Peter the Great Bay: Results of 20-Year Monitoring (1997–2016)
The reproduction period of the sea raven Hemitripterus villosus were studied by visual SCUBA-diving methods in 1997–2016 in Peter the Great Bay, the Sea of Japan. It has been found that the beginning and the end of the spawning period shifted to a later date (5–12-day shift) in particular years, which is explained by the increased water temperature at the spawning grounds by 1.6–2.5°C in September–October. The degree of damage of the open egg masses has greatly increased (from 35.2 to 60.4%), the main predator is the sea urchin Mesocentrotus nudus. The observed changes in the timing of reproduction and an increase in the degree of egg consumption by predators are not critical factors for reducing the abundance of the sea raven.
